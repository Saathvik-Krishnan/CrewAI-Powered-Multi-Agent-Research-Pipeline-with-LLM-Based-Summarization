These agents utilize AI to monitor, decide, and act across supply chain operations. They function by taking a natural language query and analyzing structured and unstructured data within their specific area of the supply chain to deliver relevant information and suggest a course of action. The Supply Chain Manager AI Agent transforms management by integrating real-time data, predictive analytics, and automated decision-making.\n\n**2) Key Findings**\n\nAI agents enable organizations to achieve core functional transformations:\n\n*   **Optimization and Planning:** AI agents provide end-to-end visibility, demand forecasting, auto-fulfillment optimization, and dynamic planning optimization in near-real time. The NVIDIA cuOpt AI agent (built using NVIDIA NIM and LLMs) serves as an AI planner that overcomes optimization challenges by transforming natural language queries into optimized plans and running what-if scenario prompts. This capability allows the analysis of thousands of possible scenarios in real time using natural language inputs i",
